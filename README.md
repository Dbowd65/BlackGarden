# BlackGarden
An area where monsters reside, and you have to survive your way out of the place to reach your goal at the end. Grab items and fight your way out of this hellish area.
This is basically a test map for new gamers to get a feel for combat, or for returning players for the most part. It is a starter area to get the pacing of both weapons, items, enemies, and other things to play Quake.
